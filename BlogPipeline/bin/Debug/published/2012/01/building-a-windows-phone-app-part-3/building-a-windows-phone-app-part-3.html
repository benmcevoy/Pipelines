    <h2>Building a Windows Phone App Part 3</h2>

<h3>Isolated Storage</h3>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh205658.aspx">A good rundown of the options</a> available show as well as IsolatedStorage there is also SQL CE and Page and Application state dictionaries.  State can be tombstoned if the app is deactivated.</p>

<p>A very interesting option is Sterling, which sounds a bit like an object oriented database: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sterling can serialize almost any
  class and organizes instances using
  keys that you provide (any property on
  the instance may be designated as the
  key). Sterling also provides indexes
  that can be queried in memory for
  speed before loading </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://sterling.codeplex.com/">Uh, yep it is exactly that.</a></p>

<p>I'm pulling XML and JSON files and as such I think it is most efficient to just cache these, allowing hydration of the object model from the URL resource or the disk.</p>

<p>using System.IO.IsolatedStorage;</p>

<p>There's one static method available here GetUserStoreForApplication</p>

<p>I have briefly used IsolatedStorageFile in another context - building a little plugin for Windows Media Center, which is like some crazy research project of Microsofts' with it's own declarative language, MCML, and whole bunch of things that look like prototype versions of Silverlight or WPF. It wasn't a weather app either, by the way.</p>

<p>To read and write files we use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.isolatedstorage.isolatedstoragefilestream%28v=vs.95%29.aspx">IsolatedStorageFileStream</a>, which needs no explaination.</p>

<p>I ended up with a helper class to wrap it up a little:</p>

<pre><code>
public static class IsolatedStorageHelper
    {
        public static bool FileExists(string path)
        {
            return Store.FileExists(path);
        }

        public static void WriteFile(string path, string content)
        {
            using (var s = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(path, FileMode.Create, Store))
            {
                using (var w = new StreamWriter(s))
                {
                    w.Write(content);
                    w.Close();
                }
            }
        }

        public static string ReadFile(string path)
        {
            if (FileExists(path))
            {
                using (var reader = new StreamReader(Store.OpenFile(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read)))
                {
                    return reader.ReadToEnd();
                }
            }
            return "";
        }

        public static bool IsFileCacheExpired(string path, int cacheHours)
        {
            if (FileExists(path))
            {
                // file more than cacheHours old
                return DateTime.Now.AddHours(-cacheHours) > Store.GetLastWriteTime(path);
            }

            return true;
        }

        public static IsolatedStorageFile Store { get { return IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); } }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I have a feeling I may run into concurrency issues some time in the future...  Watch the FileAccess/FileShare parameters...</p>

<h3>Making Requests for Resources</h3>

<p>WebClient.DownloadAsync, "piece of piss", as they say.</p>

<pre><code>
        public void Get(Uri uri, string path)
        {
            var wc = new WebClient();

            wc.DownloadStringCompleted += (s, e) =&gt;
            {
                IsolatedStorageHelper.WriteFile(path, e.Result);
                WeatherService.Current.Refresh();
            };

            wc.DownloadStringAsync(uri);
       }
</code></pre>

<p>This did not work, throwing a NotSupported exception.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/fiddler/archive/2010/10/15/fiddler-and-the-windows-phone-emulator.aspx?Redirected=true">Looking closer with fiddler</a> but that shows me not much.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4588372/is-there-any-way-to-download-ftp-files-with-windows-phone-7-net-4">Oh bummer</a> . . .</p>

<p>So, WebClient wraps HttpWebRequest and does not support ftp.</p>

<p>One of my requirements is to NOT have to provide hosting.  Also proxying the data could be against the BOM copyright/usage thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.socket%28v=VS.96%29.aspx">Sockets?</a></p>

<p>Great.  Now implement the FTP protocol.</p>

<p>I am starting to lose faith here. . .</p>

<p>Some rapid learnings later:</p>

<ul>
<li>FTP is a text based protocol, like HTTP</li>
<li>You can do it "raw" with TELNET</li>
</ul>

<p>So between the sockets example and <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/bigpapa/archive/2007/11/05/C-heart-RAW-FTP.aspx">these raw commands</a> I'm now getting:</p>

<p>I have some refactoring to do...  Hopefully I will end up with a really simple FTP client using Silverlight sockets.  This is a bit more than I was expecting, but making something like this will probably be quite useful. For someone.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4588372/is-there-any-way-to-download-ftp-files-with-windows-phone-7-net-4">Maybe this guy.</a></p>

<p>Looks like there will be a Part 4. And Part 5.  It's beer time now, but I hope tomorrow I will actually have something running on my real live phone and not just the emulator.</p>
