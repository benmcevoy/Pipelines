<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-au/store/app/falling-stars/d1af821d-291c-46ba-b82e-12dd768784a9">Falling stars</a>, put it in the game category and it gets shitloads of downloads. at first. but then after re-categorizing to children it starts to pick up again.  Gotta get that black line going up.</p>

<p>This is more the reality for a lot of crap i think.  9 downloads in 4 months? :) and then I killed it.</p>

<p>Another one, just looking at 2013 so far, ticking along at about 35 downloads a day, mostly weather, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-au/store/app/myki-balance/f21f2943-51a1-4b00-bb97-a4d0fdd4aa1a">myki</a> and Falling stars.</p>

<p>This week <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-au/store/app/falling-stars/d1af821d-291c-46ba-b82e-12dd768784a9">Falling Stars</a> was "featured" in the Chile and then the Spanish markets. I'm told I should have put a price on it, then I might have made... 20 bucks?</p>

<p>At least i don't crash as much. 400+ crashes in a day? Ouch! <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-au/store/app/myki-balance/f21f2943-51a1-4b00-bb97-a4d0fdd4aa1a">Myki</a> was down I think...</p>
