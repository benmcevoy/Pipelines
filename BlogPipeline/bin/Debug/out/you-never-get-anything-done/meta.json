{"published":"2012-05-18T07:00:00","summary":"It is worth noting, particularly as I found it quite confusing, that the length of the degree is measured perpendicular to the line of latitude - so the line of latitude runs east-west, but it's value indicates the north-south position (distance from the equator).  This will obviously be [some function of latitude and is in fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LongitudeLength_of_a_degree_of_longitude): pi/180 * radius * Cosine(degree of latitude) Which can be simplified to (as circumference = 2 * pi * r, or radius = c/2 * pi) circumference/360 * Cosine(latitude) or 111320m * Cosine(latitude) The Perfect(ish) Line Given all that I can now write, with some confidence: var threshold = Math.Pow(2f, 16f - zoomLevel) / 1113.2; ","keywords":"*, =, latitude, zoom, , level","slug":"you-never-get-anything-done","title":"You Never Get Anything Done"}
