{"published":"2012-01-29T06:00:00","summary":"Only phone applications are locked to only using [well known ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers) (21, 23, 25, 80, 443 etc), or [from a range between 4502-4534](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645032%28v=vs.95%29.aspx) > One additional restriction on using the sockets classes is that the destination port range that a network application is allowed to connect to must be within the range of 4502-4534.  It is possible for a target server to receive connections on a port from this restricted range and redirect it to a different port (a well-known port, for example) if this is needed to support a specific existing application protocol.
