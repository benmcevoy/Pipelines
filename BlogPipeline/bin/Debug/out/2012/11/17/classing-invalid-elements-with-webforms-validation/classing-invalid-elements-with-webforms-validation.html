<h2>Enhancing Web Forms Validation</h2>

<p><em>Oh woe. I am working (at work at least) pretty much exclusively in the land of legacy .NET WebForms. This has lead me to build a kind of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/benmcevoy/webforms.framework">"remedial framework"</a>. I haven't had the courage to inflict that on any production system, but writing it has helped me deepen my understanding, particularly around validation and reflection. The following is a little bit more of that.</em></p>

<p>I have been working with the standard WebForms validation of .NET 2.0-3.5 and had forgotten how "old school" it is all is.</p>

<p>I <strong>moderately</strong> like the validator controls.  They are crap compared to a more unobtrusive approach, such as using data- attributes, and they leave your markup looking very crufty, but at least they are declarative and simple to use.</p>

<p>One thing that particularly irks, however, is the lack of classing on an invalid element.</p>

<p>The display of validation elements works by evaluating each "<strong>evaluationfunction</strong>" and then showing or hiding the corresponding span that contains the validation errormessage or text.</p>

<p>What it doesn't do is look at all the validation rules for the "<strong>controltovalidate</strong>" as a set.</p>

<p>The JavaScript emitted by WebForms is in webuivalidation.js which you can inspect either in the browser (it's one of those WebResource.axd requests) or you can see it using reflector as a resource in the System.Web assembly.</p>

<p>Two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>JavaScript is dynamic, so we can add and delete functions to an object and reassign those functions as we wish.</p></li>
<li><p>The WebForms validation script leaks all of its methods to window.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>After a bit of <em>noseying</em> around I <em>picked</em> on window.ValidatorValidate as a likely culprit to override.</p>

<p>My first attempt went something like:</p>

<pre><code>
  var original = window.ValidatorValidate;

  window.ValidatorValidate = function(){

    original();

    // do more stuff like apply a class
    alert('hey, this seems to work');
  };
</code></pre>

<p>This seems dodgy... Some googling "override javascript functions" later yielded a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Proxy_Pattern">nicer proxy pattern, courtesy of 
the jQuery API docs</a>.</p>

<p>In the end I've settled on the following.  It adds an "error" class to invalid elements. I took a dependency on jQuery as I couldn't be bothered writing addClass/removeClass functions. This function should be run onready, or after webuivalidation.js has loaded.  It's self executing so just drop it in and see what breaks!</p>

<pre><code>
  (function ($) {
    if (window.ValidatorUpdateDisplay) {
        var proxied = window.ValidatorUpdateDisplay;

        window.ValidatorUpdateDisplay = function () {
            onBefore(arguments);

            var result = proxied.apply(this, arguments);

            onAfter(arguments);

            return result;
        };

        var onBefore = function (arguments) {
        };

        var onAfter = function (arguments) {
            var control = document.getElementById(arguments[0].controltovalidate);
            var validators = control.Validators;
            var isValid = true;

            for (var i = 0; i &lt; validators.length; i++) {
                if (!validators[i].isvalid) {
                    isValid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (isValid) {
                $(control).removeClass('error');
            } else {
                $(control).addClass('error');
            }
        };
    }
  })(jQuery);
</code></pre>
