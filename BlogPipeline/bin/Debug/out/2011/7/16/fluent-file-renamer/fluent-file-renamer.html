<p>For some reason I seem to have a large collection of files that are named similarly, but not consistently. A fluent file renamer interface can fix that for me.</p>

<p>A fluent API is one where we always return the same instance, allowing chaining of method calls.  (Or prehaps the same type if we are a value object, think string.Replace("foo", "bar").Replace("fee", "fii") etc).</p>

<p>e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>
    var renamer = new Renamer("my dODgy file Name.leet.720p.s01E02.mkv")
                .ChangeExtension("avi")
                .MakeTitle()
                .Replace("leet", "");
</code></pre>

<p>The esssence of it is, always return <strong>this</strong> or an object of the same type.</p>

<pre><code>
    public class Renamer
    {
        public FileName FileName { get; set; }

        public Renamer(string fileName)
        {
            FileName = new FileName(fileName);
        }

        public Renamer ChangeExtension(string newExtension) 
        {
            FileName.Extension = newExtension;
            return this; 
        }

        public Renamer Clean()
        {
            Replace(@"\.\.", @".")
                .Replace("  ", " ")
                .Replace("--", "-")
                .Replace("__", "_");

            return this;
        }

        public Renamer MakeTitle()
        {
            var textInfo = new CultureInfo("en-US", false).TextInfo;
            FileName.Name = textInfo.ToTitleCase(FileName.Name);

            Replace(" And ", " and ")
                .Replace(" Of ", " of ")
                .Replace(" In ", " in ")
                .Replace(" The ", " the ")
                .Replace(" Is ", " is ")
                .Replace(" For ", " for ")
                .Clean();
            return this;
        }

        public Renamer Replace(string match, string replace)
        {
            FileName.Name = Regex.Replace(FileName.Name, match, replace, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
            return this;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I had intentions of providing a little WPF app over the top of this to open a directory and clean up all the file names therein.  The user would be able to add multiple rules, provide any arguments required and chain them all up for processing.</p>

<p>As it turns out that sort of scenario is better served by a Rules Engine or something similar.  As enamoured as I am with the fluent interface, I think i will end up refactoring it away into a class per rule.  And for same reason there is a voice in the back of my head muttering <strong>expression tree</strong>. C'est la vie.</p>
