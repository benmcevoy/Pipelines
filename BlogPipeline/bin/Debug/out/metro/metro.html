<p>No blog post this week :)  </p>

<p>I have spent some time instead sorting out <a href="https://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/665/url-rewrite-module-20-configuration-reference/">url redirects and rewrites</a> so I can have:</p>

<ul>
<li>A canonical domain name <a href="http://benmcevoy.com.au">benmcevoy.com.au</a></li>
<li>Multiple domains running on my hosting</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the url module was quite awful.  Most of the time was spent trying to find the documentation and swearing.</p>

<p>And I spent some time dinging up a new home page, influenced by the new metro style in Windows 8.  Any one running &lt;IE9 – I care not for you.  I’m trying to pull in my last tweet and blog post into the tiles, but there are still a few bugs to be ironed out.  Works fine in FF! I think it looks pretty good (for me)!</p>

<p>For sake of posterity here she is:</p>
