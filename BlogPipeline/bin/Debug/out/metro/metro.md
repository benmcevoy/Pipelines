No blog post this week :)  

I have spent some time instead sorting out [url redirects and rewrites]( https://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/665/url-rewrite-module-20-configuration-reference/) so I can have:

 - A canonical domain name [benmcevoy.com.au](http://benmcevoy.com.au)
 - Multiple domains running on my hosting

Using the url module was quite awful.  Most of the time was spent trying to find the documentation and swearing.

And I spent some time dinging up a new home page, influenced by the new metro style in Windows 8.  Any one running &lt;IE9 – I care not for you.  I’m trying to pull in my last tweet and blog post into the tiles, but there are still a few bugs to be ironed out.  Works fine in FF! I think it looks pretty good (for me)!

For sake of posterity here she is:
