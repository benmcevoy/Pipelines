[Melbourne weather][1], I'm sure that's a correlation between temperature and downloads.

[Falling stars][3], put it in the game category and it gets shitloads of downloads. at first. but then after re-categorizing to children it starts to pick up again.  Gotta get that black line going up.

This is more the reality for a lot of crap i think.  9 downloads in 4 months? :) and then I killed it.

My whole portfolio.  Can you spot the "game" releases?

Another one, just looking at 2013 so far, ticking along at about 35 downloads a day, mostly weather, [myki][7] and Falling stars.

This week [Falling Stars][9] was "featured" in the Chile and then the Spanish markets. I'm told I should have put a price on it, then I might have made... 20 bucks?

At least i don't crash as much. 400+ crashes in a day? Ouch! [Myki][11] was down I think...
