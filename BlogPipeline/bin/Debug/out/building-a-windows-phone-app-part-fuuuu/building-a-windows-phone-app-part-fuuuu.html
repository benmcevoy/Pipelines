<h2>Building a Windows Phone App Part FUUUU!!!!</h2>

<h3>I Give Up</h3>

<p>I really feel quite despondent, like I've failed.  It just isn't possible to use the BOM FTP.</p>

<p>FTP can be in one of two modes, active or passive.</p>

<p>In passive we create a control channel, in which we connect, log in, and send control commands like change directory and retrieve file.</p>

<p>The FTP server responds with the message:</p>

<p>227 Entering Passive Mode (134,178,63,130,233,247)</p>

<p>This provides an IP Address (134.178.63.130) and port (233*256 + 247).  We open a second connection to this server port.  When we send a RETR message, for instance, the server streams the file back on this transmission port.</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Only phone applications are locked to only using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">well known ports</a> (21, 23, 25, 80, 443 etc), or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645032%28v=vs.95%29.aspx">from a range between 4502-4534</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One additional restriction on using the sockets classes is that the destination port range that a network application is allowed to connect to must be within the range of 4502-4534. These are the only destination ports allowed by a connection from a Silverlight application using sockets. If the target port is not within this port range, the attempt to connect will fail. It is possible for a target server to receive connections on a port from this restricted range and redirect it to a different port (a well-known port, for example) if this is needed to support a specific existing application protocol. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahhh... that little, inconsequential restriction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the rest of the internet cares not one hoot about Windows Phone 7 socket port restrictions and will continue using, in the case of the BOM, high range port numbers for FTP connections.  </p>

<p>The logic for the port restriction is to make it easier for admins to lock down Silverlight apps and the Phone.  But not much use to me.</p>

<h3>What about Active?</h3>

<p>Ah-ha! I think, How about active?</p>

<p>In an active connection we tell the server to open a connection to US, providing our IP Address and port number. Then we open a socket and start listening.</p>

<p>Only the socket on the Phone has no Listen abilities.</p>

<p>Which again, is reasonable, from a security perspective.   More reasonable than the arbitrary port restrictions on outgoing traffic.</p>

<h3>So Fuuuu!!!</h3>

<p>It's really depressing.  I can connect to the FTP server, list files and directories, change directory, hell even request a file.</p>

<p>I just can't receive any files. Nor can I be sent any files.</p>

<p>It just isn't allowed.  Unless you elevate to trusted. Which isn't allow on the phone.</p>

<p>So I give up on this idea.  I can't (won't) provide a proxy.  If this worked out OK I'd want to extend it to pull the weather based on location, or for multiple locations.  Then I have to start proxying large amounts of the BOM's copyright data. So no go.</p>

<h3>Sign up  at Marketplace</h3>

<p>So what the hell, I went and signed up at the market place.  I had been given a free 12 month subscription, and registration unlocks the phone to allow app deployment locally.</p>

<p>There are some things to be aware of when registering.  You are signing up for XBOX dev as well, and it's gets a bit confusing as you end up on the xbox domain during the registration.</p>

<p>If you wanna get paid you also have to fill out a bunch of forms to tell the United States tax office not to tax your income.  It's obviously not an Australian marketplace as such, but a US one.</p>

<h3>Deploy to a Real Phone</h3>

<p>Once signed up your apphub account will be associated with a windows live ID.  You can then use the Windows Phone Developer Registration tool from the 7.1 SDK to register the phone as developer unlocked.</p>

<p>This took about ten attempts:</p>

<ul>
<li>turn off skype</li>
<li>if you once ran Chevron then make sure there are no dodgy host entries that loopback the webservices. Ahem.</li>
<li>reboot the phone</li>
<li>reboot the machine</li>
<li>reboot the phone again</li>
<li>try again</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually it decided to work.</p>

<p>Now we can use the Application Deployment tool form the SDK to deploy the XAP to the phone.</p>

<p>Just that I have no working application and I am giving up for the time being.</p>

<h3>The End</h3>

<p>I need some new ideas.  This time I'll:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure they only rely on web/http stuff</li>
<li>are possible before I start (so a bit of prototyping first)</li>
<li>don't require building complex chunks of missing functionality (like FTP Clients or WMA encoders)</li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah. Bummer.  I hate to say impossible, but just really, ridiculous difficult, or possible, but only if you want to root the phone or some other hack.</p>
