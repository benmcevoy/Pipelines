<h2>CSV the file format that would not die</h2>

<p>The comma seperated value format is ubiquitous, simple and yet at the same time quite a massive pain to work with.  The lack of a standard, even to the point of "comma" meaning a comma, tab or any old delimiter, or how a record can have varying columns, or the use of the <em>reserved</em> delimiter as data makes parsing CSV fun fun fun! FUN!</p>

<p>Given it's age and ubiquity it's surprising that there isn't a native, or .NET framework, library available to us...</p>

<p>Sure there's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms128079.aspx">Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParser</a>, but that namespace is nasty uh-huh; or using the OLEDB JET driver to treat it as a datasource, which sounds even worse; or <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9258/A-Fast-CSV-Reader">this</a> or <a href="http://filehelpers.sourceforge.net/">that</a> (which are probably the right choices).  Oh hey, and let's not forget <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/25133/LINQ-to-CSV-library">LINQ to CSV</a>!</p>

<p>Convential wisdom states</p>

<ul>
<li>someone else has already solved this problem, better than you can</li>
<li>don't use regex when the data isn't regular</li>
<li>the "right" answer for this problem is probably a lexer/parser</li>
</ul>

<p>To hell with convential wisdom I say, here is my crack at it!</p>

<p>Given a CSV as a big old string we can parse it and map it onto a DTO class, thereby getting an uncool CSV back as a very nice enumerable of T.  And everyone likes an enumerable of T.</p>

<p>The map is a dictionary mapping a DTO property name to a CSV column ordinal.  As the CSV is processed we reflect over the DTO properties to find the type, and as long as it a string, integer or double, you're gold!  As you may be able to tell, I did not need any more types than that.  In fact, no-one should ever need more than three types. Right?</p>

<p>Now... this code has a number of issues, and I really wouldn't use it where performance counted.  Ideally we would stream the CSV source in, avoiding memory pressure, increasing speed and so on.  And we'd handle the many, varied and colourful deviations that CSV files can throw at you.  And avoid reflection. And split this out so the CSV parsing was it's own concern. And so on.</p>

<p>But... it was kinda fun to write.  It's fine for a small file, and it has the added goodness of automatically mapping a column from the CSV to a property on a class.</p>

<p>The actual "parser" as such I nicked from <a href="http://www.blackbeltcoder.com/Articles/files/reading-and-writing-csv-files-in-c">here</a>, it's not great either, but better than my first five minute attempt at trying to just use string.Split(',')</p>

<p>I'm pretty pleased to say I managed to ignore all convential wisdom, squeezing some RegEx, string manipulation and even a little reflection into this home brewed monstrosity.  And I certainly didn't write a lexer or parser.</p>

<p>In some ways I've replicated <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/25133/LINQ-to-CSV-library">LINQ to CSV</a>, but without the tight coupling and attribute decoration.  And probably also without the functionality, testing and performance, but that's a different issue.</p>
